Work from CS211 - Algorithms & Data Structures at Maynooth University.


* **Lab 1:** - Occurences of characters in a string.

* **Lab 2:** - Huffman encoding.

    * Convert a character String into a binary string Huffman encoding.

* **Lab 3:** - Collatz length.

    * Collatz: Start with any number. If even, divide by 2. If odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. How many steps until you get to 1?

    * Sort a set of numbers in a given range by their Collatz sequence, and then output the xth number in the sorted list. If two numbers have the same Collatz length, then the smaller number should come first.
  
* **Lab 4:** - Decrypt ElGamel

    * Eavesdrop on some ElGamal communications between Alice and Bob. You know Alice's public key, hack out her private key (or Bob's choice of random number) and use it to decrypt the message being sent to her by Bob. Then output the message.

* **Lab 5:** - Little to big endian

    * The goal is to convert a 32-bit integer from Little Endian to Big Endian encoding.

* **Lab 6:** - Hashtable

    * The goal is to insert all the words into the hash table and then find them all again with the minimum number of collisions.

* **Lab 7:** - Palindromic bases

    * Take in a number and output the number of bases from base 2 to base 10 in which it is palindromic.
    * Example: 585 is palindromic in 3 bases, namely base 10 (585), base 8 (1111) and base 2 (1001001001).

* **Lab 8:** -  Calculate the distance between two GPS locations on earth.

* **Lab 9:** - Game of life

    * In this problem, the board is a 20x20 grid. No cell outside the 20x20 grid can come to life. To get from the current state to the next state, there are only 2 rules:
        1. If a blank cell touches 3 other live cells, it will come to life (includes diagonals, there are 8 neighboring cells touching every cell)
        2. If a live cell touches 2 or 3 other live cells, then it stays alive, otherwise it dies and goes blank

    * Enter number of states to run for and output number of live cells at the end.

* **Lab 10:** - Hangman

    * AI that guesses the random word picked.

* **Lab 11:** - Cirular primes
