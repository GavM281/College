**CS210 labs**

* **Lab 1:** Luhn algorithm
* **Lab 3:** Primes
* **Lab 4:** Monte Carlo
* **Lab 5:** Sorting
    * In this task the input is two numbers, followed by a series of strings. Those strings must be sorted and then one particular string must be outputted. The first number denotes the quantity of strings to follow. The second number indicates which string should be outputted following the sort. For example, if it's a 3, then output the string that 
falls in third place. If it's a 5 then output the string that falls in fifth 
place.
    * The sorting that should be applied is as follows: sort words by their length, with the shortest words coming first. If two words have the same length, then sort them in reverse alphabetical order (i.e. with "zoo" coming ahead of "ape")

* **Lab 6:** Stacks
    * Manipulate a stack according to the given push and pop commands and then output the biggest number that is left on the stack. If a pop command is issued for an empty stack then 
nothing should happen.

* **Lab 7:** Queues
    * Manipulate a queue according to the given insert and remove commands and then output the string that is in the middle of the queue. If there is an even 
number of strings in the queue, thus two middle strings, output the one which is nearest the front. If a remove command is issued for an empty queue then nothing should happen.

* **Lab 8:** Linked Lists
    * Find the highest value in the linked list. Go through the double-ended doubly-linked list to find the largest int value held in any of the links. If the doubly linked list is empty or defective in any way, return 0. 
    * The main method was already completed, I wrote the search() method which reports to the main method.

* **Lab 9:** Long division using recursion.
* **Lab 10:** Given a multiple lists of numbers remove any multiples of three from each list of numbers and then sort the sublists by the number of elements remaining within them, with the sublists containing the most items coming first.
